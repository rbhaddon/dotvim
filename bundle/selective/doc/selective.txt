INTRODUCTION                                        *selective*

Selective is a Vim plugin that improves the behavior of movement keys (arrows,
home, end, etc.) and text selection when dealing with soft-wrapped text.


REQUIREMENTS                                        *selective-requirements*

This plugin was developed and tested under the GUI version of MacVim 7.3. (It
will probably work under other versions of Vim as well, but hasn't yet been
tested on them.)


INSTALLATION                                        *selective-installation*

Selective installs like any other global Vim plugin. Just follow the
instructions under |add-global-plugin|.

(If you're reading this via the Vim online help system, then the plugin is
probably already installed.)


USAGE                                               *selective-usage*

Selective remaps movement keys (arrows, Home, End, etc.) to work more
naturally with soft-wrapped text. With it installed, these keys (including
their shifted variants) move by display lines instead of physical lines.

Selective does not remap h/j/k/l or other "native Vim" motions. It only
affects the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down (and some command
key combinations on the Macintosh).


OPTIONS                                             *selective-options*

The Selective plugin does not (yet) expose any configuration options, other
than the usual g:loaded_selective variable for controlling whether the plugin
should be loaded or not.


LIMITATIONS                                         *selective-limitations*

It is surprisingly complicated to convince Vim to do some of these tricks.
There are still a few edge-case bugs that haven't been squashed, mostly around
the selection of the last character on a line, and I won't be surprised if
there are more still lurking. Please let me know if you discover any
unexpected behavior.
